    <!--Q!: What is HTML?-->
    <!--
    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
    HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
    HTML describes the structure of a Web page
    HTML consists of a series of elements
    HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
    HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
    It is worth noting that HTML is not a programming language, it only describes the structure of the web pages

        <h2>This is a paragraph from an interesting article I read about learning and effort</h2>
        <pre>
    Previous research has shown that the prospect of attaining a reward can promote task-engagement,
    up-regulate attention toward reward-relevant information, and facilitate enhanced encoding of new information into declarative memory.
    However, past research on reward-based enhancement of declarative memory has focused primarily on paradigms in which rewards are 
    contingent upon accurate responses. Yet, findings from test-enhanced learning show that making errors can also be useful for learning 
    if those errors represent effortful retrieval attempts and are followed by corrective feedback. Here, we used a challenging general 
    knowledge task to examine the effects of explicitly rewarding retrieval effort, defined as a semantically plausible answer to a question 
    (referenced to a semantic knowledge database www.mangelslab.org/bknorms), regardless of response accuracy. In particular, we asked whether 
    intermittent rewards following effortful incorrect responses facilitated learning from corrective feedback as measured by incidental 
    learning outcomes on a 24â€“48 h delayed retest

        The difference between:
        1) b and strong ==> b is for making the text bold, strong is for indicating that the contained text is important, however
        the contained text in the strong tag is also bold, but strong enhances accessibility
        2) i and em ==> i is for making the text italic, em is for emphasizing the text, the contained text in em tags
        is in italic, but as we mentioned in strong tags, em ehnances accessibilty
        3) s and del ==> both are used to indicate removed text from the document
        s is used for text that is no longer valid or is outdated, stylistic purposes
        del is used when a text is intentionally removed from the content, for semantic purposes
        4) As we've mentioned above, s is for styling outdated information, ins is for
        the highlighting the updated information
