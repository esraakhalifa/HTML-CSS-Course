        <h1>Best Places to Shop Vintage</h1>
        <p>
            Ask me who makes my dress/skirt/bag, and nine times out of ten, I’ll respond, “it’s vintage!” With a closet chock-full of ’50s, ’60s, and ’80s pieces,
             I’ve been able to suss out the best places to shop vintage online. Vintage die-hards might tell you that in order to get the good stuff, you’ll have to go off-line. Generally, vintage dealers don’t e-tail. Plus, you need to touch, feel, and (most importantly!) try on your vintage before you give it a new life.
 But that said, there are corners of the internet that offer a trove of vintage. That is, if you know what you’re looking for.
